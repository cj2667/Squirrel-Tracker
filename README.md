# Welcome to Squirrel Tracker!!

## General Description
We created a Django online App which allows users to track squirrels' locations and more detailed information.
The data imported in this App is from *[2018 Central Park Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw)*
